== Description ==

Qbloc by Qwanz is a free plug in that allows you to easily create polls and petitions which can be embedded on your site or blog.

Qbloc provides you with demographic insights about your readers, (age, gender, location), expands the reach of your content, and brings you new traffic, all while enabling users to get heard by decision makers and making your site a "go to" place where visitors can go daily, knowing their opinions counts.

Qbloc benefits WordPress sites and their users by:

*	Providing validated poll results through a mandatory but quick registration process (username, password, email) or by using Facebook Connect.

*	Giving your readers a voice and empowering them to make a difference, by letting them automatically submit your poll results to the decision makers of their choice, including U.S. elected officials, government agencies, corporations and over 20,000 journalists worldwide.

*	Enabling you to create your own poll or select one from the thousands of polls already in our database, many from leading websites with significant votes already. 

*	Allowing the poll you selected or created to be fully customized with an image, a logo, fonts, colors, borders, sizes, type of poll, number of responses, registration requirements, duration, etc.

*	Letting you better understand your audience by getting feedback by age, gender and location through an optional extended registration.

*	Giving more content and instant feedback to readers on issues they care about

*	Increasing engagement and time on site by sparking new conversations related to your content.

**About Qwanz**

*Qwanz is a fun, easy to use platform for daily democratic participation*. If you're on Qwanz, you're a game-changer, a world-shaper, a political gangster; you have opinions, you have a voice, and you want to be heard. 

You've got your go-to news outlets right? Various sources where you get your information? Of course, we all do. But, here's a question: Where's your public opinion outlet? 

Qwanz is designed to fill that void in the democratic landscape. We're a hub for public recourse, a place for you to react to the day's latest and greatest, to test the claims you've heard in popular media, to propose your own solutions for the public to consider, and, above all else, to GET INVOLVED. 

We thought about petition sites, and how thousands, even millions of people coming together in protest can be a powerful force of change. But a protest is one-sided it only accounts for the people who feel one way on an issue. A poll, on the other hand, reveals the whole composition. It can be used constructively, to prove public sentiment, and to call for change just the same way as a petition, but without all the limitations. 

Here on Qwanz, you make a poll, take a poll, vote, comment, debate, engage, and then you can go a step further. QWANZ IT. Send poll results directly from the site to where you think they should go, public officials, corporations, government agencies, or any one of 20,000 journalists with stakes in the question at hand. 

We provide you with the concept, the tools, the platform, and the network. 

This is Qwanz. How will you use it?

== Frequently asked questions ==
**Why do users need to register to vote?**

The main reason we ask users to register, is to insure that your Qbloc polls are validated and that, for each poll, there is only one vote per registered user. Just like registering to leave a comment on a site, once registered, users will not have to do it again.
Voters can simply register with Facebook or by giving a username, e mail and password. 
Later you can ask for an extended registration and users will then have to add their gender, location and their birth year. 
For you it means getting a better understanding of who your audience is by age, gender and location; it also enables your users to see how people with similar demographics voted on an issue.
How people voted based on these demographics is available right from the Qbloc results page for anyone who is registered. Unregistered users will not see poll results.
Also users need to be registered to enable the Qwanzit function, enabling them to get heard by sending results to decision makers or any one of 20,000 journalists worldwide (see below).
On your first few polls you can add the following paragraph explaining how your users will benefit by registering. These explanations are also visible when you roll over the Qbloc and at sign in. 
Note: You are being asked to register to make sure that poll results are validated and that your vote is counted only once; for that we need to verify that you are in fact a person. 
Once enough votes have been received, poll results can automatically be sent by any registered user to US elected officials, government agencies, corporations or to any one of 20,000 journalists worldwide.

**If I ask my readers to register, won't less of them vote than if they do not need to register?**

You are right; on their first use of our Qbloc, sites who used it will usually get 35% to 50% of the number of votes they usually get on their polls, but on the second Qbloc it rises to 50% to 65% and by the fourth or fifth they are at 95% +.  After that it seems to go over 120% as users understand the benefit of getting heard and are more inclined to answer validated opinion polls.
Users understand the value of,  together, making their vote and opinions count on what matters to them, ...because one voice may not be heard but thousands together cannot be ignored &trade;. 
On your first few polls you can add the same paragraph as above explaining why users will benefit by registering.


**What sets Qbloc by Qwanz apart from other polling solutions?**

*	It lets you better understand your audience by getting feedback by age, gender and location 
*	It gives your readers a voice, empowering them to make a difference, by letting them automatically submit your poll results to decision makers including US elected officials, government agencies, corporations and over 20,000 journalists worldwide
*	It expands your content and brand exposure both, by having your poll available for blogs and sites to embed  across the web, and by having users send your results to decision makers or share them with friends through Facebook or twitter. (some of the Qwanz polls have been shared over 10,000 times on Facebook)

*	Save or reduce expenses as our polling tools are completely free. No maximum voting levels; No contracts. 

**What's the difference between a Qbloc and a Qzip?**

While Qbloc polls are designed to fit between your content and your comments sections, a Qzip, is designed to fit hidden in a link titled =See what people think= which fits anywhere in your content, often after the introduction paragraph or in the body of your copy; when clicked Qzip opens into your fully customized Qbloc poll, and can be closed by simply clicking on it again.
It was developed at the request of users who wanted to include polls in a less visible way. 

**What sets Qbloc by Qwanz apart from petition tools?**

*	Unlike regular petitions that only show one side of the issue, it allows the parties petitioned to see what percentage of individuals are supporting an idea or a cause. Petitions are often dismissed because they are thought to only represent a small percentage of individuals.
*	Virtually all petition sites and tools are geared to petitioning a set and defined organization or individual; With Qbloc you are the one who select to whom you want to send it among US elected officials, government agencies, corporations and over 20,000 journalists worldwide; and you can send it to as many as five people a day.
*	Unlike leading petition sites that will disclose the name and physical address of users who are petitioning, at Qwanz we will never disclose and personally identifiable information.
*	With a traditional petition, you cannot petition a coach because he left a particular player on the bench but with Qbloc, you can and you can send the results to your favorite sports journalist to publish.


**How do users select who to send poll results to?**

Anyone who has voted can send results to decision makers; choosing who to send it to is fast and easy.
Once the Notify the Press button is green on a Qbloc, you can send a Qwanzit with the results of the poll.
When you click Notify the Press you will see which groups you can send to in Green and by clicking on a group you can refine your delivery to a particular journalist covering a sports or politics in particular country.  Each group has different vote requirements and you can only do five Qwanz it a day.
How does Qbloc act as a petition? 
Petitions are written notifications made by many people demanding a specific action from an authority or government. Qbloc provides such a tool by verifying that users are registered with a real email; the Qbloc question and answers acts as the message to pass on in the appeal or request to the person to whom the results are being sent. Aside from showing more than one side of an issue the main advantage of Qbloc is allowing for registered users to send on the results to the person of their choice. If an elected government official decides to do nothing, users can send the poll to the press to get their voices heard.

**Are users' votes anonymous?**

Yes; absolutely; users votes by using their user names but even if a user uses his own name as a user name, individual votes are never made available on an individual basis in poll results; results are always provided in a group, as a whole. How a user votes individually is not available unless he/she decides to make it so in his/her Qwanz profile.
In addition, Qwanz values and protects your privacy. We will never sell your personally identifiable information to any third part entity. Ever!

**How do users share the poll and their vote in social networks and with others?**

Users can share the poll from the social (e.g. Facebook & Twitter) sharing buttons that are displayed on Qbloc results section of the poll, or by using the QwanzIt "Notify the Press" button, that once green, enable users to send poll results to US elected officials, government agencies, corporations or to any one of 20,000 journalists worldwide.

**What are the benefits of using Qbloc & Qzips tools?**
